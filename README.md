### Auto spammer / catcher for discord bot pokecord

Gotcha! Is VB.Net application that monitors the users screen and checks for a pokemon spawn/level up. If a pokemon spawn is found then it will automatically attempt to catch the pokemon. Please keep in mind my screen shots of the pokemon might night work for you, in which case you might have to make your own screen shots.
> I might make a tool to automate this late since you can screen shot the pokemon from the _p!market search --name_ command results

It also uses sendkeys so it takes over the users keyboard when sending chats. The spam chats are customizable from the basic settings, and the pokemon you want to scan for can be selected or deselected. The bot also sends email notifications if you choose to, and will notify you if you find;
* Legendary
* Mythic
* Ultra Beast
* Alola

Because it takes over your keyboard, it has to select discord, so before each message it re-selects the discord window, it does this using the window name, i.e _#general - Discord_ in this example the channel name is _general_ so in the advanced settings you can set two channel names, one is for the auto spam/catch and the other is for the quick commands. Quick commands allows users to send quick pokecord commands that are needed frequently, such as;
* Toggle detailed view for p!info
* Order p!info by
  * Alphabetical
  * Number
  * Level
  * IV
* Select Latest pokemon caught
* Info via p!info <selected/latest>
* Pokemon [p!pokemon] by
  * All
  * Shiny
  * Alolan
  * Mega
  * Legendary
  * Mythical
  * Ultra Beast
* Pokedex via p!pokedex <owned/unowned>
* Nickname change
* Favorites list
* Check ballance
* Claim pokedex rewards
 
 The bot also saves your output logs to /logs so you can quick search if you need to.
