### Auto spammer / catcher for discord bot pokecord

# IF YOU NEED TO GET NEW IMAGES FOR POKECORD TO AUTO CATCH THEN USE THE IMAGE SCRAPER HERE PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE COORDINATES PROBABLY WONT WORK FOR YOUR RESOLUTION THOUGH:

Gotcha! Is VB.Net application that monitors the users screen and checks for a pokemon spawn/level up. If a pokemon spawn is found then it will automatically attempt to catch the pokemon. Please keep in mind my screen shots of the pokemon might night work for you, in which case you might have to make your own screen shots.
> I might make a tool to automate this late since you can screen shot the pokemon from the _p!market search --name_ command results

It also uses sendkeys so it takes over the users keyboard when sending chats. The spam chats are customizable from the basic settings, and the pokemon you want to scan for can be selected or deselected. The bot also sends email notifications if you choose to, and will notify you if you find;
* Legendary
* Mythic
* Ultra Beast
* Alola

Because it takes over your keyboard, it has to select discord, so before each message it re-selects the discord window, it does this using the window name, i.e _#general - Discord_ in this example the channel name is _general_ so in the advanced settings you can set two channel names, one is for the auto spam/catch and the other is for the quick commands. Quick commands allows users to send quick pokecord commands that are needed frequently, such as;
* Toggle detailed view for p!info
* Order p!info by
  * Alphabetical
  * Number
  * Level
  * IV
* Select Latest pokemon caught
* Info via p!info <selected/latest>
* Pokemon [p!pokemon] by
  * All
  * Shiny
  * Alolan
  * Mega
  * Legendary
  * Mythical
  * Ultra Beast
* Pokedex via p!pokedex <owned/unowned>
* Nickname change
* Favorites list
* Check ballance
* Claim pokedex rewards
 
 The bot also saves your output logs to /logs so you can quick search if you need to.

_Please keep in mind if you use multiple monitors, this only scans your *primary monitor*_
_You will have to play with the window size of the discord app, you want it big enough for the bot to try more than once if there is no catch, but enough to bump the pokemon off the screen if there is a catch, but not a level. It's tricky but doable, somewhere near 1117 x 647 on my monitor._

### THIS BOT IS NOT PERFECT AND DEPENDS HEAVILY ON IMAGE DETECTION, THE SMALLER AND MORE DISTINCT THE REFERENCE IMAGE THE FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE THE RESULTS, MY SCREEN SHOTS PROVIDED MIGHT NOT WORK ###

**I will consider making a scraper to auto send commands and pull up pokemon from pokecord and take a screen shot but that might be way in the future.**
