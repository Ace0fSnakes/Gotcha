_Please keep in mind if you use multiple monitors, this only scans your *primary monitor*_
_You will have to play with the window size of the discord app, you want it big enough for the bot to try more than once if there is no catch, but enough to bump the pokemon off the screen if there is a catch, but not a level. It's tricky but doable, somewhere near 1117 x 647 on my monitor._

### THIS BOT IS NOT PERFECT AND DEPENDS HEAVILY ON IMAGE DETECTION, THE SMALLER AND MORE DISTINCT THE REFERENCE IMAGE THE FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE THE RESULTS, MY SCREEN SHOTS PROVIDED MIGHT NOT WORK##

**I will consider making a scraper to auto send commands and pull up pokemon from pokecord and take a screen shot but that might be way in the future.**

Images coming soon.
